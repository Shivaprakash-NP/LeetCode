Okay, let's break down how a typical Java solution for the LeetCode "Word Ladder" problem works.  I'll explain the general approach and common techniques, even though you haven't provided code.  I'll then provide a well-commented code example.

**Understanding the "Word Ladder" Problem**

The "Word Ladder" problem is about finding the shortest transformation sequence from a `beginWord` to an `endWord` using a given `wordList`. The rules are:

1.  You can only change one letter at a time.
2.  Each transformed word must exist in the `wordList`.

**General Approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

The most common and efficient way to solve this problem is using Breadth-First Search (BFS).  Here's why BFS is suitable:

*   **Shortest Path:** BFS inherently finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph (where each transformation has the same "cost" of 1).
*   **Level-by-Level Exploration:** BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that you find the closest transformations first.

**Steps in a BFS Solution**

1.  **Preparation:**

    *   **Store the `wordList` in a suitable data structure:**  A `Set` (like `HashSet`) is often used for fast lookups to check if a word exists in the list.  This avoids repeatedly iterating through a `List`.
    *   **Queue for BFS:**  A `Queue` (like `LinkedList`) is essential for BFS. It holds the words to be explored.
    *   **Visited Set:** A `Set` (like `HashSet`) to keep track of the words you've already visited to avoid cycles and redundant processing.
    *   **Initialization:** Add the `beginWord` to the queue and the visited set.

2.  **BFS Loop:**

    *   **While the queue is not empty:**
        *   **Get the current word:**  Dequeue a word from the front of the queue.
        *   **Check if it's the `endWord`:** If the current word is equal to the `endWord`, you've found the shortest path. Return the current level/distance from the `beginWord`.
        *   **Generate possible next words:**  For each letter in the current word:
            *   Try changing that letter to every other letter in the alphabet (a-z).
            *   If the resulting word is in the `wordList` AND hasn't been visited:
                *   Add the new word to the queue.
                *   Add the new word to the visited set.
        *   **Increment Level:**  After processing all words at a certain level, increment the level counter (distance from `beginWord`).

3.  **No Solution:**  If the queue becomes empty and you haven't found the `endWord`, it means there's no transformation sequence possible. Return 0.

**Code Example (with Comments)**

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        // 1. Preparation

        // Convert wordList to a Set for efficient lookups.
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordList);

        // If the endWord is not in the wordList, there's no solution.
        if (!wordSet.contains(endWord)) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Queue for BFS
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(beginWord); // Add the starting word to the queue

        // Set to keep track of visited words
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(beginWord);

        int level = 1; // Distance from beginWord (start at 1, not 0)

        // 2. BFS Loop
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size(); // Process all words at the current level
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                String currentWord = queue.poll(); // Get the next word to explore

                if (currentWord.equals(endWord)) {
                    return level; // Found the endWord!
                }

                // Generate possible next words by changing one letter at a time
                for (int j = 0; j < currentWord.length(); j++) {
                    for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
                        // Create a new word by changing the j-th character
                        char[] charArray = currentWord.toCharArray();
                        charArray[j] = ch;
                        String newWord = new String(charArray);

                        // Check if the new word is valid and unvisited
                        if (wordSet.contains(newWord) && !visited.contains(newWord)) {
                            queue.offer(newWord); // Add it to the queue
                            visited.add(newWord);   // Mark it as visited
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            level++; // Move to the next level
        }

        // 3. No Solution
        return 0; // No transformation sequence found
    }
}
```

**Explanation of the Code**

*   **`ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList)`:**  This is the main function that takes the starting word, ending word, and the list of valid words as input.
*   **`Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordList);`:** Converts the `wordList` to a `HashSet` for efficient `contains()` checks.
*   **`Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();`:**  Creates a queue to hold the words to be processed in the BFS.
*   **`Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();`:** Creates a set to track visited words to avoid cycles.
*   **`level = 1;`:** Initializes the level (distance from the `beginWord`) to 1 (since the `beginWord` is the first word).
*   **`while (!queue.isEmpty())`:** The main BFS loop continues as long as there are words to explore in the queue.
*   **`int size = queue.size();`:** Gets the size of the queue at the beginning of each level.  This is important because we only want to process the words that were added to the queue *at the previous level* before incrementing the `level` counter.
*   **`String currentWord = queue.poll();`:** Dequeues (removes) the next word from the queue.
*   **`if (currentWord.equals(endWord))`:** Checks if the current word is the target `endWord`.  If it is, we've found the shortest path.
*   **Generating Neighboring Words:** The nested loops iterate through each character of the `currentWord` and try replacing it with every letter of the alphabet ('a' to 'z').  This creates all possible one-letter transformations.
*   **`String newWord = new String(charArray);`:** Creates a new `String` from the modified character array.
*   **`if (wordSet.contains(newWord) && !visited.contains(newWord))`:** Checks if the `newWord` is a valid word (exists in the `wordSet`) and hasn't been visited yet.  This prevents cycles and ensures that we only explore valid transformations.
*   **`queue.offer(newWord);`:** Adds the valid and unvisited `newWord` to the queue for future exploration.
*   **`visited.add(newWord);`:** Marks the `newWord` as visited.
*   **`level++;`:** Increments the level after processing all words at the current level.
*   **`return 0;`:** If the queue becomes empty before finding the `endWord`, it means there's no valid transformation sequence, so the function returns 0.

**Key Improvements and Considerations**

*   **Efficiency:** Using a `HashSet` for `wordList` lookups is crucial for performance.  `contains()` on a `HashSet` is O(1) on average, while `contains()` on a `List` is O(n).
*   **Space Complexity:**  The space complexity is primarily determined by the size of the queue and the visited set, which can be at most the size of the `wordList` in the worst case.
*   **Bidirectional BFS (Optimization):** For more significant optimizations, especially with larger word lists, consider Bidirectional BFS. This involves searching from both the `beginWord` and the `endWord` simultaneously, which can significantly reduce the search space.  However, it adds complexity to the code.
